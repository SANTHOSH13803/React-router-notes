1> When we need to use params in routes use the below syntax
    syntax :   
        <Route path='path/:userId' element={<UserDetails />} />

2> To access the params in the url use "useParams" hook (react-router-dom)
    It returns key value pairs.

    syntax : 
        const params = useParams();
        const userId = params.userId; //The name should be same as in Route

3> Search Params (i.e, Query parameters)
    useSearchParams gives to things like useState hooks,
    but the functionality is different.
    
    how to invoke a query to url? 
        onClick = {()=> setSearchParams({filterName : 'filterValue'})}
        
        To clear the filter pass empty object to setSearchParams in above line

4> Absolute Links and Relative Links

    In Absolute Links we write '/' then only it works
    Whereas in Relative Links we don't write them.

    the prefered way is Relative links , it avoids confusion while we are using 
    nested routes.
