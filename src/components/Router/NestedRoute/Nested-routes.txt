1> When user navigate to Invalid routes we need to navigate it to "No page found".


In App.js
......
<Route path='*' element ={<NotFound/>} />

In the above line should be always in the last route,
the '*' means its if no routes are found it takes the * route.


2> NestedRoutes 
    React can also navigate a portion of page to its 
    corresponding other route.
