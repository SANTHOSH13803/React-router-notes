1> NavLink (react-router-dom)
== "NavLink" functionality is same like "Link" , NavLink adds a classname 'active' for the current page link 
    It's is used for navbar purpose.

    Syntax : <NavLink to='pathname'/>

2> useNavigate (react-router-dom)
    when we need to programatically navigate to other pages(like on button click)
    eg: going to 'order successful' page on click on place order.

    -> useNavigate hook returns a funtion, we need to pass the path to the funtion
    
    Syntax:
        const navigate = useNavigate()
        ....
        navigate('about-page') //navigates to about page  
    
    Tip:
        sometimes we need to navigate to the previous page,
        to acheive it use below

        Syntax: 
            navigate(-1) //this allows us to navigate to before page
